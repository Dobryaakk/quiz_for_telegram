## 🤖 Description of the Bot:

QuizMaster Bot is designed to bring quiz entertainment to your Telegram groups! 🤖🧠

### Main Features:

- **Quiz Generation:** Create and send quizzes to your groups at scheduled times or on demand. 📚🕒

*Note: This bot is a work in progress and is designed for personal use. As the creator, I prefer not to manually send quizzes to my channel and developed this bot to automate the process. It's currently in its early stages, and a full-featured version may be developed in the future.*
